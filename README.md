# rtrvl

Rtrvl is a simple browser-based game built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla Javascript. It is based on an original concept I sketched on a coffee cup while riding the blue line from Forest Park to Jackson Blvd. No frameworks were utilized in its creation. At its core, Rtrvl boasts four levels of collision detection written entirely in HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. Although it is not actively being worked on, I do plan to add more levels sometime in the future.

#### How to play:

Using your arrow keys, retrieve all of the red circles while avoiding the dastardly blue squares.
